While you are not required to read these rules, not being aware of them is not and never will be an excuse to not follow them. Repeat offences are subject to increased punishments. Please note that while this post covers all of the basic rules, it is by no means a comprehensive list of every punishable action - a healthy dose of common sense does wonders in keeping one out of trouble.
                        <strong>Please note that breaking some rules will have worse punishments than others.  </strong>
