					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> So what's a 'Clan' anyway? Why bother?</p>

					<p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Like many online communities, Toribash has its very own <i>Clan</i> system. Clans were put in place to allow groups of like-minded individuals to band together and form their own sub-communities within the wider world of Toribash.

						People come together to form clans for all sorts of reasons. From a simple social grouping to players interested in being the best around, the clan system lets players find their own place within the community and be part of something larger than themselves.<br></br>

					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> But how does it all work? How can I get a clan tag in front of my name?</p>

					<p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> In Toribash, the core of a clan is called the ToriClan. This is the part of your clan which is registered into Toribash's database and allows you to wear your clan tag in game. The ToriClan allows members to structure their clan by giving members ranks and permissions. Players in a Toriclan will wear their clan's tag in front of their name in-game.<br/><br/>

					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> Is that all? How am I meant to communicate with my clanmates?</p>

					<p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Linked to the ToriClan is the clan's thread - this is the thread where you can talk to your clanmates about whatever you'd like (so long as it follows the global rules of the community).<br/><br/>

					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How come some clan tags are in square brackets? What are these 'official clans' all about?</p>

					<p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Clans who feel they are worthy may apply to become official clans. Official clans don't just have their own thread - they have their own subforum, which can contain as many threads as they please. Official clan tags are also different: they use [square brackets] over the unofficial (parenthesis).<br/><br/>

					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> What if I want to prove that my clan is the strongest there is?</p>

					<p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Members of a ToriClan may also wage war on other clans! The current ranking of Toribash's most successful warring clans can be found <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/clan_list.php">here!</a><br/><br/>

					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> Is there any other way to prove my clan's talent?</p>

					<p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Many <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/forumdisplay.php?f=37">events</a> are run throughout the year, ranging from in-game tourneys through to replay making and art. Often, these events will require not just individuals, but clans to compete together in order to claim the prize. As such, events can be a very nice way to show off your clan's abilities, whether they be in-game prowess or some other talent. One to look out for is the yearly Clan League event. This is a prestigious annual event that has been running for many years. All of Toribash's strongest clans are sure to be competing for the huge prizes in this event!</p>

					<br/>

					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> None of these clans seem to be what I'm looking for - could I create my own clan?</p>

					<p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> You can absolutely create your own clan! The full walkthrough of clan creation, management and expectations can be found in <strong><a href="http://forum.toribash.com/showthread.php?t=592763">this thread (READ IT FIRST)</a></strong>. Leading your very own clan can be quite an experience, although it will often require some dedication to pull off correctly.</p>

					<br/>

					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> I've read the info, but I'm still confused about something - is there anybody I can go to for help?</p>

					<p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Yep, the <a class="faq_clanSquad">Clan Squad</a> is a team of community members who dedicate their time to ensure the smooth running of clans in Toribash. Sometimes you may run into some trouble that a <a class="faq_clanSquad">Clan Squad</a> member cannot handle for you - in these cases, you should ask a member of <a class="faq_clanManagement">Clan Management</a>. These are the guys who oversee <a class="faq_clanSquad">Clan Squad</a> and can also edit ToriClans directly. The current members of staff in charge of clans are as such:</p>
