					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> So what makes a 'good' password?</p>
                    <div class="faq_answer">
					<p ><span class="faq_a">A:</span> A good password is one that:</p>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Can't be guessed by another person</li>
                        <li>Can't be broken via <span class="faq_hoverExplain" title="A brute force attack consists of an attacker (usually a computer program) trying as many passwords or passphrases as it can.">brute force</span>.</li>
                        <li> Can't be guessed via a <span class="faq_hoverExplain" title="A dictionary attack is a technique for defeating a password by trying hundreds or sometimes millions of likely possibilities, such as words from a dictionary.">dictionary attack.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The technical details of these types of attacks is not necessary for you to understand, however it is important to know that a computer can perform the latter two attacks extremely efficiently. A decent PC can try <strong>hundreds of millions</strong> of passwords a second. Utilising a good GPU, <strong>billions</strong> can be tried every second.</p>
                    <p>A good password, then, is one which is able to resist every type of attack.</p>
                    <p>You can always check the strength of your password on sites like <a href="https://howsecureismypassword.net/">this one</a>.</p>
                    </div>
                    <br/><br/>
                    
                    
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How do I make a good password?</p>
                    <div class="faq_answer">
                    <p><span class="faq_a">A:</span> There are two main approaches to this question. The first of them is very commonly used (and is also usually worse). 
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>1. Making your own password:</strong><br/><br/>The first method is to think up a password yourself. This is probably the fastest approach, although you should keep several points in mind when making a new password:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Your password should be as long as you can make it while still being able to memorize it</li>
                      <li>You should include as many types of characters as possible, including UPPERCASE, lowercase, numbers (0-9) and symbols (@, ~, !, etc.)
                      <li>It should avoid consisting of just one or two common words</li>
                      <li>Making common switch-outs for characters (such as changing an 'e' with a '3') helps less than you think (although switching characters like this is still a good idea)</li>
                      <li>Including easy-to-find personal information in your password (SUCH AS YOUR BIRTHDAY) is extremely bad practice</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Brute force attacks begin to fail when password length gets too long, so anything above 10 characters in length is moving into safer territory. If you also include a lot of noise into your password (random characters and swapped characters), dictionary attacks will have a harder time. <strong>So a decent password can be something as simple as: 'aPp1e_snuMer4cyClockkeyb0Ard'</strong> - that is just four words: 'apples' + 'numeracy' + 'clock' + 'keyboard' mashed together with some noise added in. <strong style="color: red;">DISCLAIMER: DO NOT USE THIS PASSWORD YOURSELF - THATS EVEN WORSE THAN USING 'PASSWORD' AS YOUR PASSWORD!</strong></p><p>This password is very long, draws on several types of characters, includes noise and breaks up the words with symbols in non-obvious ways. Above all, it isnt too hard to remember. Our site from earlier agrees: </p>

                    <br/>
                    <p><strong>2. Using a password manager:</strong></p>
                    <p>A password manager combined with a randomly generated password is probably one of the best approaches to account security. Randomised passwords stored in a manager do not need to be memorised and therefore don't need to be short, readable, include real words or any of the other vulnerabilities standard passwords have. Many modern browsers include password management already, but there are other dedicated programs and apps for password management across all devices. For example, I could ask <a href= "https://passwordsgenerator.net/">https://passwordsgenerator.net/</a> for a 32-length password such as "<strong>{_AX=&lt;q$nD3y,#6=swB&lt;w`T6?aMctNqz</strong>". If I store this in a password manager, I can now freely use a password which, according to our friend <a href="https://howsecureismypassword.net/">howsecureismypassword.net</a>, would take a long time to break:</p>
                    <img style="margin: auto; display: block;" src="https://i.imgur.com/EFNv2RA.png"/>
                    <p>Making new passwords like this also keeps you from re-using the same password for a lot of different sites. This is <em>extremely</em> good for you, since if one of the sites you use is hacked into, your same password-username combo will likely be tried across many different sites. <strong>Just make sure the password to your password manager itself is also difficult to break - this will technically be the only password you'll ever have to remember.</strong>

                    <div class="faq_answer">
                    <p><span class="faq_a">A:</span> The final piece of the puzzle when it comes to account security is common sense.</p>
                    <ul><li>Toribash staff will never, ever ask for your password.</li>
                    <li>You should never tell anybody your password under any circumstance.</li>
                    <li>Make sure you have a decent firewall/antivirus on your device. A keylogger will completely undo even the strongest passwords</li>
                    <li>Finally, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">make sure your account uses a real email which you can access.</span> If you ever need your password reset, this is an excellent method for us to verify who you are</li>
                    <li>Only use your password to login to *.toribash.com, not t0ribash.org, tori.ru, toricredits.net or any other third-party site.</li>
